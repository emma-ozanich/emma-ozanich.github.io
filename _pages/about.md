I'm a scientist who uses statistics and signal processing to answer acoustics questions. My research used data-driven machine learning models to localize and characterize sound sources, and I currently use data analysis in R and Python to interpret the impacts of underwater construction sound on marine wildlife.
One thing I love about my work are the rare but gratifying data-driven epiphanies! I'm currently learning about and getting certified in PostgresSQL and relational databases on freeCodeCamp.

I'm a runner for fun - on the road and trails - and proud cat owner. Be it budgeting while running, or automating my workflow, I 
love more efficient ways of getting things done!
