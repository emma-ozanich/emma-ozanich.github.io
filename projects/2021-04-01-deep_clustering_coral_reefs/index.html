The known labels from the simulations were used to test the model performance.</p> <p>Three cases were considered: equal-sized groups (classes) of whale song and fish calls <strong>(a-c)</strong>, inequal-sized classes of whale song and fish call <strong>(d-f)</strong>, and equal-sized clsases of whale song, fish call, and whale song overlaying fish call <strong>(g-i)</strong>. Since we suspect many more fish calls than whale song after observing the experimental data, we test the effect of inequal class size on the model.</p> <p align="center"><img src="/assets/images/DEC_simulated.png" alt="drawing" width="60%"></p> <p>Observing that DEC does not perform well for inequal class sizes, we added the Gaussian mixture means (GMM) method for comparison. GMM was applied directly to the kernels from CAE without additional training of the DEC. The DEC algorithm uses the K-means assumption of equi-distant clusters (fixed-variance Gaussians), whereas GMM learns the variance and the cluster means, allowing it to optimize cluster sizes.</p> <p align="center"><img src="/assets/images/DEC_experiment_updated.png" alt="drawing" width="60%"></p> <p>Using some hand-labeled events detected in the experiment data, we show that the GMM does perform better than DEC due to the class imbalance in the real data. Unlike curated data, these raw data contain multiple, often overlapping, signals with varying SNR, including unknown signals not accounted for. Additional array processing and human labeling is needed to raise the accuracy from 77% to &gt;90%.</p> <p align="center"><img src="/assets/images/messy_classifications.png" alt="drawing" width="60%"></p> </body></html>
