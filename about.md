I'm a scientist using statistics and data analysis to answer interesting questions. 
My research has used machine learning to localize ocean sound, and I'm currently using R and Python to statistically interpret the impacts of underwater construction sound on marine wildlife.
I enjoy finding unexpected trends in data!

My goal as a data scientist is to build skills and versatility.
If you are looking for a scientist who can build, validate, and interpret complex data models and dig into difficult questions -- please send me an email and let's discuss!
