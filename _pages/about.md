I'm a scientist specializing in statistics and signal processing. As a researcher, I developed data-driven machine learning models to better localize and characterize sound sources. 
Since working in industry, I've used a variety of data analysis techniques in R and Python to interpret the impacts of underwater construction sound on marine wildlife.
I really love data-driven epiphanies (those a-ha trends you never expected!) and I'm currently using freeCodeCamp to learn about PostgresSQL and revisit my machine learning background.

Outside of work, I'm a passionate runner - on the road and trails - and a proud cat owner and past foster-parent. And whether I'm running while budgeting or just automating my workflow, I 
love finding more efficient ways of getting things done!
