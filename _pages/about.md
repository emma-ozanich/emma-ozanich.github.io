I'm a project/data scientist with a PhD in signal, array processing and machine learning for ocean science applications.
With 8 years of research and industry experience, I specialize in timeseries data analysis, prediction, and visualization. 
Recently, I've been self-learning data table packages in R and cloud compute tools in AWS Skill Builder and Coursera.

I enjoy a good data analysis problem -- I love finding more efficient and accurate ways of getting things done!
