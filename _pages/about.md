I'm a scientist who uses statistics and signal processing to answer acoustics questions. My research used data-driven machine learning models to localize and characterize sound sources, and
since working in industry, I use data analysis in R and Python to interpret the impacts of underwater construction sound on marine wildlife.
I really love data-driven epiphanies and I'm currently using freeCodeCamp to learn about PostgresSQL and machine learning.

For fun I'm a runner - on the road and trails - and proud cat owner. Whether running while budgeting or automating my workflow, I 
love finding more efficient ways of getting things done!
